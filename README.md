# RSVP Movie Data Analysis Using SQL

## Project Overview

This project involves analyzing a dataset of movies released over the past three years to provide actionable insights for RSVP Movies, an Indian film production company. The company is preparing for a new global release in 2022 and is keen to plan every move based on data. Using SQL, I examined various aspects of movie performance, audience preferences, box office trends, and more to give recommendations that will guide their next project.

The analysis is divided into four segments, with each segment exploring different combinations of tables from the dataset to uncover key insights. The results of this analysis will help RSVP Movies to strategically plan their upcoming release for a global audience.

## Project Goals

- **Understand market trends**: Analyze movie data to understand trends in audience preferences, box office collections, and movie performance.
- **Identify key factors**: Identify which factors (genre, release date, cast, etc.) contribute most to a movie's success.
- **Provide recommendations**: Use the insights from the data to recommend strategies for RSVP Movies’ global release.
- **Enhance decision-making**: Help the company make informed decisions based on historical movie data.

## Data Analysis Process

### 1. Data Exploration
- **Loading and inspecting data**: Initially, the dataset is loaded and explored for any missing values, inconsistencies, or other anomalies.
- **Data Cleaning**: Clean the data by handling missing values and ensuring consistency.
  
### 2. SQL Queries and Insights

The analysis is done using SQL queries to derive insights from different combinations of tables. The following segments were covered:

- **Segment 1**: Analyzed basic movie details like title, genre, and release date. Identified patterns in genre popularity and seasonal release trends.
  
- **Segment 2**: Looked into box office performance and ratings to see which factors most correlate with high-performing movies.

- **Segment 3**: Investigated audience demographics, including country of origin, to identify regional preferences.

- **Segment 4**: Focused on the impact of actors, directors, and other key contributors on the overall success of a movie.

### 3. Data Insights & Visualization

- Created detailed reports highlighting important trends and patterns that could impact RSVP’s future success.
- Used visual aids, such as charts and tables, to illustrate these insights for better understanding.

## Key Insights

- **Genre Trends**: Identified which genres perform best in different countries and during different seasons.
- **Box Office Performance**: Found key factors that contribute to higher box office collections and ratings, including star power and genre.
- **Regional Preferences**: Uncovered which countries have the most active audiences for RSVP Movies' productions, allowing the company to tailor future releases.
- **Influence of Cast and Crew**: Discovered how key actors and directors impact movie success, helping RSVP choose their talent wisely.

## Recommendations

- **Targeting Global Audiences**: The insights show which genres and types of movies perform well in global markets, helping RSVP Movies target the right audience for their upcoming release.
- **Seasonal Releases**: Avoid certain months or target specific times of the year for the release of high-budget movies based on seasonal trends.
- **Focus on Star Cast**: Leverage the influence of popular actors and directors to boost movie success, especially for international releases.
  
## Tech Stack

- **SQL**: Used to query and analyze the movie dataset.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Used for organizing and presenting the analysis.
- **Excel**: For some basic visualization and data manipulation.

## Repository Contents

- **SQL Script File**: The SQL script containing all queries used to analyze the data and draw insights.
- **Executive Summary (PDF)**: A detailed write-up summarizing the key findings and recommendations for RSVP Movies.
- **Dataset**: The dataset CSV file.

## Conclusion

This project provides in-depth data-driven insights to guide RSVP Movies in planning their global release. By leveraging SQL queries, I analyzed key factors affecting movie success and provided recommendations to enhance their decision-making process. This analysis will be crucial for ensuring their next project resonates with a global audience.
